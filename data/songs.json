And next time I show up to court I'll be naked and just wear a law suit Judge be like  \"That's sharp How much that motherfucker cost you  smart-ass?You're lucky I don't tear it off you And jump your bones  you sexy motherfucker!You're so fuckin' gravy  Marshall  I should start callin' you 'au jus'‘Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo\"Evil Twin  take this beat now  it's all you I believe people can change but only for the worse I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse—so satanic K-Mart chains panic ‘cause they can't even spin back the curse words‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed  motherfucker Rekcufrehtom! — Tihs! And these kids are like parrots They run around the house just like terrorists Screamin'  \"Fuck! Shit! Fuck!\"Adult with a childish-like arrogance Wild ever since the day I came out  I was like  \"Merits?Fuck that! I'd rather be loud  and I like swearin'\"From the first album even the gals were like  \"Tight lyrics  dreamy eyes!\"But my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition Hogger of beats  hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius who's bored of his lines And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now Feel like I might just strike first  then ignore the replies There's darkness closing in   there it goes again It controls my pen   but that ain't me  it's my evil twin But he's just a friend  who pops up now and again So don't blame me   blame him  it's my evil twin Welcome back to the land of the living  my friend You have slept for quite some time So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?Nah  F with Christina I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba My album's just sicker than strep with the fever Get the Chloraseptic  Excedrin  Aleve  or Extra Strength Tylenol 3s Feel like I'm burnin' to death  but I'm freezin'Bedridden and destined never to leave the Bedroom ever again  like the legend of Heath-uh-Ledger My suicide note's barely legible; read the Bottom  it's signed by the Joker Lorena said I never can leave her She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her Fuck that shit  bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver Golly wolly  I vent  heat register  Jesus Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny When on the steps  I met De Shaun at Osborn I'd never make it to sophomore I just wanted to skip school and rap Used to mop floors  flip burgers  and wash dishes While I wrote rhymes  tryna get props for 'em‘Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em They were sleepin'  I made 'em stop snorin'Made 'em break out the popcorn Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows Leanin' on the horn  screamin'  \"Fuck the police \" like cop porn Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn Fuck top five  bitch  I'm top four And that includes Biggie and Pac  whore And I got an evil twin So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?And crazy as I am  I'm much tamer than him  and I'm nuts Then again  who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?But no one's insaner than Slim  look at that  please come in; what was your name again?Hi! Faggot Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there Two rabbits  a koala bear  and a ball of hair And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there Peace to Whitney Jeez  just hit me That I should call the Looney Police to come get me‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth I wish someone'd finally admit me To a mental hospital with Britney Oh  LMFAO  no way  Jo--se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J.  no Hooray  I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony  hey ho I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to \"Hip Hop Hooray\"No  I’m hollerin'  you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8And I  whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so Let your low-end raise  yo Tango  what you think  ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?What  you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?Change that tune  you ain't got a remote chance to control me Ho  I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner Superman try to fuck me over  it won't hurt Don't try to fix me  I'm broke  so I don't work So are you  but you're broke ‘cause you don't work But all bullshit aside  I hit a stride Still Shady inside  hair every bit as dyed As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize‘Cause we are the same Bitch You might also like194Embed"
